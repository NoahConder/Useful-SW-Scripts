# Useful-SW-Scripts
Personal repo of scripts I use in my day-to-day.

Included is a .env that will need to be changed for allowing some scripts to work.
```dot.env
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE=Your-Space-Name-Goes-Here.signalwire.com
SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT=Project ID Goes Here
SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN=API Token Goes Here
PHONE_NUMBER=SW Number Goes Here
```
